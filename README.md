# Getting Started with Floor Management App

## Project Overview

The Floor Management App is built to simplify the task of organizing and managing room layouts and their tables. It allows users to create custom floor plans with tables that can be adjusted, edited, or removed as required.

## Getting Started

### `Add Rooms:`

Click the "Add Room" button to create a new room.\
Provide the room name and other details.

### `Add Tables:`

After creating a room, click "Add Table" to add tables to the selected room.\
Fill in the table details and save them.

### `Manage Tables:`

Drag and drop tables to arrange their positions.\
Click the delete icon to remove a table.\
Double-click on a table to edit its details.

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
